## ABOUT

I built this to automate a tedious task: searching Google for keywords and recording
where certain domains are located in the first 5 pages or so.

This tool searches the first 100 results (twice as many as the original requirement),
looks at the nonpersonalized results (what someone else might see - though others' 
personalized results might be different from this, too).

Please be gentle with your constructive criticism.
